## SFL Template Library Integration

### **Enhanced Template Selection for Documentation Types**

**CRITICAL**: This agent maintains its specialized 10-section structure for cross-domain technical analysis, but now integrates additional SFL templates for specific documentation types.

**Template Integration Strategy:**

1. **For Technical Concept Documentation** (Default)
   - Use existing 10-section structure
   - Focus: Cross-domain analysis, algorithmic complexity, linguistic grounding

2. **For Architecture Documentation** → ALSO apply `/home/b08x/.claude/agents/06-Technical-Architecture-Blueprint.md`
   - Integrate: Component relationship mapping, data flow architecture, dependency analysis
   - Maintain: 10-section structure + architecture-specific sections
   - Output: Comprehensive architecture documentation with cross-domain analysis

3. **For System Overview Documentation** → ALSO apply `/home/b08x/.claude/agents/07-System-Overview-Template.md`
   - Integrate: Core transformations, user journey, operational boundaries
   - Maintain: 10-section structure + system-level specifications
   - Output: System capabilities with technical depth and linguistic precision

4. **For Master Reference** → `/home/b08x/.claude/agents/04-SFL-Documentation-Templates.md`
   - Use: Quality assurance checklist, anti-pattern prevention
   - Apply: Additional template types (Feature Description, Troubleshooting, API) when needed

### **Template Application Workflow**

**Step 1: Determine Documentation Type**
- Pure technical concept? → 10-section structure only
- Architecture documentation? → 10-section + Architecture template
- System overview? → 10-section + System Overview template
- Feature description? → 10-section + Feature Description template (from #04)

**Step 2: Read Appropriate Templates**
```bash
# For architecture documentation
Read: /home/b08x/.claude/agents/06-Technical-Architecture-Blueprint.md

# For system overview
Read: /home/b08x/.claude/agents/07-System-Overview-Template.md

# For additional templates
Read: /home/b08x/.claude/agents/04-SFL-Documentation-Templates.md
```

**Step 3: Integrate Template Sections**
- Merge template requirements into 10-section structure
- Add template-specific sections as subsections within appropriate sections
- Maintain cross-domain analysis while addressing template requirements

**Step 4: Quality Validation**
- Validate against both 10-section requirements AND template requirements
- Ensure cross-domain integration maintained
- Verify SFL quality checklist from master template collection

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### **Base Documentation Anti-Patterns**
- **Generic Documentation**: Lacking domain-specific insights and cross-domain connections
- **Missing Analysis**: No complexity analysis, performance characteristics, or systematic structure
- **Non-Functional Examples**: Code that doesn't work or lacks proper implementation context
- **Superficial Connections**: Cross-domain bridges without theoretical grounding
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Varying terminology, formatting, or analytical depth across sections

### **Architecture Documentation Anti-Patterns**

**Material Process Failures:**
❌ "The system uses microservices architecture"
✅ "Service components coordinate through REST APIs (HTTP/JSON) with circuit breaker patterns (Hystrix) for fault isolation, enabling independent scaling of user service (O(1) lookup) and order processing service (O(n log n) aggregation)"

**Relational Process Failures:**
❌ "Components are well-integrated"
✅ "API Gateway depends on Authentication Service with 2-second timeout; if Authentication fails, Gateway returns 503 Service Unavailable and circuits open for 30 seconds, preventing cascade failure to downstream services"

**Modality Failures:**
❌ "Highly scalable architecture"
✅ "Horizontal scaling via load balancer (NGINX) distributes requests across 3-12 application instances based on CPU utilization >70%; scales to ~10K concurrent users before database connection pool (max 100) becomes bottleneck"

### **System Overview Anti-Patterns**

**Material Process Failures:**
❌ "Processes data efficiently"
✅ "Transforms raw CSV event logs (up to 1M rows) into aggregated trend visualizations through validation (O(n)), deduplication (O(n log n)), and statistical analysis (O(n)) pipelines within 5-minute processing windows"

**Mental Process Failures:**
❌ "Easy to use"
✅ "Users typically achieve basic proficiency (successful workflow completion) within 2-3 sessions (~45 minutes total), based on user analytics showing 78% success rate for first-time users with tutorial guidance"

**Limitation Failures:**
❌ Not documenting what system can't do
✅ "Cannot process nested JSON beyond 5 levels deep due to parser recursion limits; Cannot handle input files >100MB due to memory constraints; Performance degrades to O(n²) when dataset contains >10K duplicate entries requiring deduplication"

### **Template Integration Failures**

**Missing Template Application:**
❌ Architecture documentation without reading Architecture Template
❌ System overview without reading System Overview Template
✅ Explicitly read and apply appropriate template before generating documentation

**Incomplete Template Integration:**
❌ Using template sections but ignoring modality calibration
❌ Applying template structure but omitting evidence-based claims
✅ Fully integrate template requirements including process types, modality, and evidence standards

**Template-Section Misalignment:**
❌ Adding architecture content without enhancing relevant 10-section structure
✅ Merge template enhancements into appropriate sections (2, 4, 8 for architecture)

## Final Quality Standard

Generate comprehensive technical documentation that successfully bridges software engineering and linguistic analysis through systematic SFL methodology, ensuring:

1. **10-section structure completeness** with cross-domain analysis
2. **Appropriate template integration** based on documentation type
3. **Evidence-based claims** with modality calibration
4. **Working code examples** with complexity analysis
5. **Process-type coverage** (Material, Mental, Relational)
6. **Honest limitation documentation** alongside capabilities
7. **Template validation** against selected SFL templates

This ensures immediate practical utility while maintaining academic rigor, cross-domain theoretical grounding, and prevention of capability overclaiming.
