# dots


Well, the goal is to have the files/tools available on any host that the user has access to
So the process would go on a new syste; download and execute the setup script with a curl command. And the resulting setup script will install yadam to the .local bin directory. And then everything from there is going to be installed self-contained within the user profile. the main thing that needs to happen here is that ansible will need to be install for the user unless it's already installed on the system

So the .setup.sh script, the first thing it does is check for ssh keys

And then so if it doesn't find any, it'll ask to generate `% ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -b 4096`
I'll have to add the public key to the git repo before continuing...

And then yes, in the rare instance that the request to generate is then denied, the bootstrap script will pull down the HTTPS version of the dots repo.

So, yeah, YADM clone then should be run in an error handling wrapper that if it detects that the checkout doesn't proceed because of there being the chance of overwriting files, It needs to get the list of files that the clone would overwrite and then back up those files. The run yadm checkout again to complete the process...

So if this is a first run, Yadam will ask if the bootstrap should be run.
And if that is answered yes, then
The YADM bootstrap sequence begins.

in yadm bootstrap script (01-setup.sh)

first prompt for system/sudo password

if the user is not in sudoers, reduce the functionality to onlys tasks that don't require root/sudo privleges*

So like for example, if the system, if
and runs
I believe the system Ruby is at like 2.9 or something
The gem installations then need to be kept to things that can be installed in the local folder.
And then so any of the non-system tools or packages that the utility scripts require would need to be installed from a pre-compiled binary, or whatever

And then so yeah, otherwise, if the check returns true for the user being in sudoers, then the full playbook can run


I guess there would be a submenu for what tags to run with the ansible-pull command

*reduced functionality would be determined by what ansible-tasks required sudo privs

Based on the uploaded `README.md`, `01-setup.sh`, and your description, you're looking to establish a robust and automated process for deploying your development environment (dotfiles and tools) onto new systems, primarily Arch Linux. The core mechanism involves using `yadm` for dotfile management and triggering an Ansible playbook (likely via `ansible-pull` or a local run) for system configuration and software installation. The bootstrap process aims to be self-contained and interactive, handling SSH keys, potential `yadm` conflicts, and varying privilege levels.

Here are some potential analysis and development tasks:

1.  **Refine Bootstrap Script (`01-setup.sh`):** Enhance error handling, dependency checks, and the `yadm` clone/checkout/backup logic.
2.  **Develop Sudo/Non-Sudo Ansible Logic:** Implement a clear strategy within Ansible to handle tasks based on available privileges.
3.  **Strengthen SSH Key Management:** Formalize the SSH key generation and GitHub integration steps within the bootstrap or initial setup instructions.
4.  **Implement `yadm` Overwrite Handling:** Create a specific, testable function to back up conflicting files before `yadm checkout`.
5.  **Review Ansible Playbook:** Ensure roles are idempotent and support both full-privilege and reduced-functionality runs.
6.  **Security Assessment:** Review the `curl | bash` pattern, sudo usage, and SSH key handling for potential security risks.
7.  **Testing Strategy:** Define a plan for testing the bootstrap process on clean Arch Linux environments (VMs or containers).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Identified Issues, Risks & Suggested Improvements

| Item (Code/Design/Requirement) | Issue/Risk Type | Description & Suggested Improvement | Severity (1‚Äì5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `curl | bash` Bootstrap | üõ°Ô∏è Security Vulnerability | Piping directly from `curl` to `bash` can be risky. **Suggestion:** Advise users to download, inspect, and then run the script. Alternatively, ensure the source URL is HTTPS and immutable if possible, and keep the initial script *minimal* (only cloning/running `yadm`). | 4 |
| `yadm` Overwrite Logic | üß© Design Flaw / ‚ùìAmbiguity | The described backup logic is complex and error-prone. **Suggestion:** Use `yadm status` to find "untracked" or "modified" files *before* checkout, then use `yadm stash` or manually `mv` them to a backup dir. Ensure the backup is *atomic* or well-logged. | 4 |
| Sudo/Non-Sudo Branching | üß© Design Flaw | Managing this *within* the `01-setup.sh` *and* Ansible can lead to complex, hard-to-maintain logic. **Suggestion:** Clearly define boundaries. Perhaps `01-setup.sh` *only* handles user-level setup and *tries* to run Ansible with `ansible-pull` or `ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass`. Let Ansible's `become: yes/no` and privilege checks handle the rest. Use tags (`sudo_required`, `user_only`) for clarity. | 4 |
| `01-setup.sh` Dependencies | üöß Risk | The script checks for `git`, `ruby`, `mdadm` but might need more (like `curl`, `tar`, build tools). **Suggestion:** Add comprehensive dependency checks early in the script, potentially offering to install them if sudo is available. | 3 |
| Error Handling in `01-setup.sh` | üêõ Bug / üöß Risk | While `trap` is used, complex flows (like `yadm` backup) need granular error handling. **Suggestion:** Add specific checks after critical commands (`yadm clone`, `yadm checkout`, `ansible-pull`) and provide clear `gum_fail` messages. Ensure `set -e` or similar is used carefully. | 3 |
| Ansible Installation Method | ‚ùìAmbiguity | User text mentions installing Ansible "for the user", but `01-setup.sh` suggests `pipx` (which might need setup) or system install. **Suggestion:** Standardize on `pipx install ansible-core --include-deps` or `uv pip install ansible-core` within a bootstrap venv, ensuring `pipx` or `uv` is installed first. Avoid system-wide `pip` installs. | 3 |
| SSH Key & GitHub | üöß Risk | Adding SSH keys to GitHub *cannot* be automated safely within the script. **Suggestion:** The script should *generate* keys and *instruct* the user (with `gum_info` and perhaps opening a browser) to add the public key manually, then wait for confirmation. | 5 |
| `gum` Installation | üöß Risk | The `gum_init` function downloads and moves `gum`, which is good, but relies on GitHub URLs and `curl`. **Suggestion:** Add checksum verification after download. Consider a fallback if GitHub is down or `curl` fails. | 2 |

## üìå Issue & Improvement Summary:

  * **Security:** The **`curl | bash`** pattern should be reconsidered or heavily secured; **SSH key handling** needs manual intervention.
  * **Robustness:** The **`yadm` conflict resolution** needs a safer, more predictable implementation; **error handling** in `01-setup.sh` needs to be more granular for critical steps.
  * **Clarity:** The **sudo vs. non-sudo** execution path needs a very clear, likely Ansible-centric, implementation to avoid script complexity.
  * **Dependencies:** Ensure all required **build tools and runtime dependencies** are checked and handled early.
  * **Ansible Setup:** Standardize the **Ansible installation** method, preferably using user-local tools like `uv` or `pipx`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Revised System/Module Overview (Incorporating Feedback):

The proposed system aims to automate workstation setup using a `yadm`-managed dotfile repository coupled with an Ansible playbook ([README.md](https://www.google.com/search?q=)). The entry point is a minimal setup script (potentially downloaded, not piped) which first handles **SSH key validation**, guiding the user to generate keys and add them to their Git provider if necessary ([User Text](https://www.google.com/search?q=)). It then **installs `yadm` and `gum`** (verifying checksums if downloaded) and checks for critical dependencies like `git` and `python`/`uv`.

The script then executes `yadm clone` using the SSH URL. If conflicts arise, it will use `yadm status` or `git status` within the `yadm` repo to identify conflicting files, **move them to a timestamped backup directory**, and re-attempt the `yadm checkout`. Once the clone is successful, `yadm bootstrap` is triggered, running the main `01-setup.sh` script ([01-setup.sh](https://www.google.com/search?q=), [User Text](https://www.google.com/search?q=)). This script uses `gum` to interactively **confirm sudo availability**. It installs `ansible-core` (preferably via `uv` or `pipx`). Finally, it invokes `ansible-playbook` (or `ansible-pull`), potentially with an `--ask-become-pass` flag or limiting tags based on the sudo confirmation. Ansible roles will handle the bulk of the setup, using `become: yes` where appropriate and checking for privileges when necessary ([README.md](https://www.google.com/search?q=), [User Text](https://www.google.com/search?q=)).

## üèÖ Technical Feasibility & Recommendation:

The overall approach is **technically feasible and a common pattern** for managing development environments. The combination of `yadm` for personal dotfiles and Ansible for system-level configuration is powerful. However, the **complexity lies in the bootstrap and error-handling logic**, especially around `yadm` conflicts and sudo/non-sudo paths. **The primary recommendation** is to simplify the *initial* setup script as much as possible, focusing only on getting `yadm` and Ansible running, and then letting Ansible handle the majority of the conditional logic and setup tasks. **High Risk** areas are the SSH key handling (requires manual steps) and the `yadm` overwrite logic (requires careful implementation). **Recommended Approach:** Proceed with development, focusing on robust error handling, modular scripting, and thorough testing in clean environments.

## üìò Development Best Practice Suggestion:

**Implement Idempotent Bootstrap & Testing:** Ensure that both the `01-setup.sh` script and all Ansible roles are fully *idempotent*. This means they can be run multiple times on the same system without causing errors or changing the final state after the first successful run. Test this rigorously by running the entire bootstrap process multiple times within a VM or container.
