# dots


Well, the goal is to have the files/tools available on any host that the user has access to
So the process would go on a new syste; download and execute the setup script with a curl command. And the resulting setup script will install yadam to the .local bin directory. And then everything from there is going to be installed self-contained within the user profile. the main thing that needs to happen here is that ansible will need to be install for the user unless it's already installed on the system

So the .setup.sh script, the first thing it does is check for ssh keys

And then so if it doesn't find any, it'll ask to generate `% ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -b 4096`
I'll have to add the public key to the git repo before continuing...

And then yes, in the rare instance that the request to generate is then denied, the bootstrap script will pull down the HTTPS version of the dots repo.

So, yeah, YADM clone then should be run in an error handling wrapper that if it detects that the checkout doesn't proceed because of there being the chance of overwriting files, It needs to get the list of files that the clone would overwrite and then back up those files. The run yadm checkout again to complete the process...

So if this is a first run, Yadam will ask if the bootstrap should be run.
And if that is answered yes, then
The YADM bootstrap sequence begins.

if the user is not in sudoers, reduce the functionality to onlys tasks that don't require root/sudo privleges*

So like for example, if the system, if
and runs
I believe the system Ruby is at like 2.9 or something
The gem installations then need to be kept to things that can be installed in the local folder.
And then so any of the non-system tools or packages that the utility scripts require would need to be installed from a pre-compiled binary, or whatever

And then so yeah, otherwise, if the check returns true for the user being in sudoers, then the full playbook can run


I guess there would be a submenu for what tags to run with the ansible-pull command

*reduced functionality would be determined by what ansible-tasks required sudo privs

This iteration focuses on the Ansible execution strategy within your bootstrap process, specifically the choice between `ansible-playbook -c local` and `ansible-pull`.

While you requested a shift to `ansible-pull`, and the previous iteration provided code for that, a deeper analysis reveals potential conflicts and complexities when `ansible-pull` is used in conjunction with `yadm` managing the same home directory, especially if the goal is to operate on the *already checked-out* yadm files and use local inventory/variable structures.

**Key Search Insights on `ansible-pull` vs. `ansible-playbook -c local`:**

  * **`ansible-pull`'s Purpose**: It's designed to pull a *remote* Git repository to a specified directory (or a default like `/var/lib/ansible/local/`) and then execute a playbook from *that checkout* against `localhost`. This is excellent for scaling and periodic remediation.
  * **`ansible-pull` and Inventory**: `ansible-pull` defaults to an inventory of `localhost`. While you *can* specify an inventory file with `-i`, it acts upon the playbook it just checked out. This means if your `inventory/inventory.ini` is part of the `yadm` checkout in `$HOME`, `ansible-pull`'s *separate* checkout might not naturally use it without explicit pathing relative to its *own* checkout directory.
  * **`ansible-pull` and Variables**: Extra vars (`-e`) work, but `ansible-pull`'s primary variable context comes from the repository it pulls. Leveraging `group_vars/` and `host_vars/` from your *yadm checkout in `$HOME`* becomes less direct with `ansible-pull`'s separate checkout.
  * **`ansible-playbook -c local`**: This command runs Ansible directly against a playbook path (e.g., within your `$HOME` yadm checkout) and targets `localhost` without needing SSH. It naturally uses the inventory and variable files (`group_vars/`, `host_vars/`) relative to the playbook's location or as specified in `ansible.cfg` within the yadm checkout. This seems to align better with using the `yadm`-managed files directly.
  * **Community Recommendation**: For complex local setups, some community discussions suggest that `ansible-pull` can be seen as a "toy implementation" and recommend a shell script that clones/updates a repo and then calls `ansible-playbook`. Your `~/.setup.sh` and `01-setup.sh` scripts are effectively doing this.

Given these points, using `ansible-playbook $HOME/main.yml -c local` (as in the script generated two iterations ago) appears to be a more straightforward and robust approach *if the goal is to run Ansible on the yadm-managed files already present in `$HOME` and utilize the local inventory/variable structure from your `README.md`*. `ansible-pull` would be more appropriate if `yadm` was *only* for dotfiles, and Ansible was a completely separate repo fetched independently.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Identified Issues, Risks & Suggested Improvements

| Item (Code/Design/Requirement) | Issue/Risk Type | Description & Suggested Improvement | Severity (1‚Äì5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ansible Execution Strategy | üß© Design Flaw / ‚ùìAmbiguity | Using `ansible-pull` with a Git URL means it creates its own checkout, potentially ignoring the `$HOME` yadm checkout for inventory, `group_vars`, `host_vars`, and the local `README.md` for tag parsing. This conflicts with the desire to use local files from the `yadm` checkout. **Suggestion:** Revert to `ansible-playbook $HOME/main.yml -c local -i $HOME/inventory/inventory.ini`. This directly uses the `yadm`-managed files and local inventory structure as described in the `README.md`, aligning better with the overall design. | 4 |
| Tag Selection Source with `ansible-pull` | üß© Design Flaw | If `ansible-pull` checks out a fresh remote copy, parsing tags from the *local* `README.md` (from the `yadm` checkout) might lead to discrepancies if the local checkout is not perfectly in sync with remote `HEAD` that `ansible-pull` would fetch. **Suggestion:** If sticking with `ansible-pull`, tags should ideally be listed by `ansible-pull --list-tags` *after* its checkout, or the tag selection logic needs to be aware it might be running against a different version. (This is moot if switching to `ansible-playbook -c local`). | 3 |
| Inventory with `ansible-pull` | ‚ùìAmbiguity | `ansible-pull` defaults to `localhost` and does not naturally use a local `inventory/inventory.ini` from the yadm checkout in `$HOME` unless the playbook itself is structured to find it relative to *its own path* after `ansible-pull` checks it out. **Suggestion:** Use `ansible-playbook -c local -i $HOME/inventory/inventory.ini` for clear inventory usage from the yadm checkout. | 4 |
| `--ask-become-pass` with `ansible-pull` | üöß Risk | While `--ask-become-pass` can be passed to `ansible-pull` (as it passes most options to `ansible-playbook`), ensuring it's non-blocking or handled well in a script needs care. **Suggestion:** The current script handles this by conditionally adding it. This is acceptable, but overall flow is simpler with `ansible-playbook -c local`. | 2 |

## üìå Issue & Improvement Summary:

  * **Ansible Execution Choice**: The primary issue is the conflict between using `ansible-pull` (which implies a separate fetch of the repo) and the system's goal of operating on the locally checked-out `yadm` files, including its local inventory and variable structure ([README.md](https://www.google.com/search?q=uploaded:README.md)). **Recommendation**: Revert the Ansible execution in `01-setup.sh` to `ansible-playbook $PLAYBOOK_PATH -c local -i $INVENTORY_PATH`.
  * **Tag Source Consistency**: Parsing tags from the local `README.md` aligns perfectly with running `ansible-playbook` against the local checkout.
  * **Inventory Simplicity**: Using `ansible-playbook -c local -i path/to/inventory` makes inventory usage explicit and leverages the files managed by `yadm`.

## üí° Potential Optimizations/Integrations:

| Idea | Potential Benefit | Confidence (1‚Äì5) | Link |

| Use `ansible-playbook -c local` | Simplifies logic, directly uses yadm checkout, aligns with `README.md` inventory structure. | 5 | [Ansible Docs](https://www.google.com/search?q=) |
| Pre-flight `ansible-inventory --list` | Before running the playbook, verify Ansible can parse the local inventory correctly. | 4 | [ansible-inventory docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-inventory.html) |
| Dedicated `vars_prompt` in Ansible | For any truly dynamic input needed by Ansible (beyond tags/sudo), use Ansible's `vars_prompt` instead of shell script prompts. | 3 | [Ansible Docs](https://www.google.com/search?q=) |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Revised System/Module Overview (Incorporating Feedback):

The system initiates with `~/.setup.sh`. This script handles hard prerequisites (`git`, `curl`), installs `gum` and `yadm` user-locally, guides SSH key setup (with an HTTPS fallback for `yadm`), and then performs `yadm clone` (using the selected URL) and `yadm checkout $HOME`, managing conflicts interactively. It concludes by running `yadm bootstrap`.

The `yadm bootstrap` command executes `.config/yadm/bootstrap.d/01-setup.sh`. This script:

1.  Initializes `gum`.
2.  Determines `sudo` availability (`HAS_SUDO`).
3.  Ensures `uv` is installed (user-locally via `curl`) and then uses `uv` to install `ansible-core` into a venv (`$HOME/.local/venvs/ansible`), adding it to `PATH`.
4.  Parses the local `$HOME/README.md` for available Ansible tags and allows user selection via `gum filter`.
5.  **Crucially, it now executes `ansible-playbook $HOME/main.yml -i $HOME/inventory/inventory.ini -c local`**. This ensures Ansible runs against the files directly managed by `yadm` in the home directory and uses the specified local inventory ([README.md](https://www.google.com/search?q=uploaded:README.md)).
6.  The `has_sudo` variable and selected tags are passed to `ansible-playbook` (e.g., `-e "has_sudo=$HAS_SUDO" --tags "$ANSIBLE_TAGS"`). `--ask-become-pass` is added if `HAS_SUDO` is true.
7.  Ansible then configures the system.

## üèÖ Technical Feasibility & Recommendation:

The overall design remains **highly feasible**. The primary **recommendation is to use `ansible-playbook -c local -i path/to/inventory` instead of `ansible-pull`** in `01-setup.sh`. This change aligns the Ansible execution with the `yadm`-centric approach of managing files directly in `$HOME` and better utilizes the local inventory and variable structure described in the extensive `README.md` ([README.md](https://www.google.com/search?q=uploaded:README.md)). This approach simplifies the logic around which files Ansible operates on and how inventory/variables are loaded. All other components (initial setup, `gum` UI, SSH/HTTPS fallback, conflict handling, `uv` for Ansible install) are sound.

## üìò Development Best Practice Suggestion:

**Define Clear Boundaries Between Bootstrap and Configuration:** The `~/.setup.sh` script should focus *only* on getting `yadm` cloned and `yadm bootstrap` running. The `yadm bootstrap` script (`01-setup.sh`) should focus *only* on getting Ansible installed and running it. Let Ansible, with its robust error handling and state management, handle all actual system configuration and package installations beyond the bare minimum needed for Ansible itself.

## ‚ú® Post-Iteration Update:

This iteration critically re-evaluated the `ansible-pull` vs. `ansible-playbook -c local` decision. Research indicates that `ansible-pull`'s behavior of performing its own checkout is less suitable for this project's goal of running Ansible against the existing `yadm`-managed files and utilizing its local inventory/variable structure. The recommendation is to revert to `ansible-playbook -c local`, which directly supports this goal. This clarifies the execution flow and variable/inventory management, making the system more coherent.
